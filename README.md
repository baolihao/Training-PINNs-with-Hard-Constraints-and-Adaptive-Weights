# PINN Experiments for Stiff Time-Dependent PDEs

This repository contains the source code and data accompanying our experiments on solving stiff time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs) using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). We evaluate our proposed scheme on **seven representative PDE benchmarks** featuring periodic boundaries and challenging dynamics, including:

- Allen–Cahn equation: Case 1
- Allen–Cahn equation: Case 2
- Cahn-Hilliard equation 
- Kuramoto–Sivashinsky equation  
- Gray–Scott reaction–diffusion system  
- Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction–diffusion system  
- Nonlinear Schrödinger equation
